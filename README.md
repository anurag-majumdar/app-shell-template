# App Shell Template

This is an example template for using the App Shell architecture which has been built from scratch using the following features:

* App Shell Architecture
* Progressive Web Application
* Critical Resource Rendering
* Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Feel free to fork this repo and use it as your starter template for your next Progressive Web Application.

## Running using local machine

In command line type the following commands:

```sh
npm install -g serve
serve
```

### Using the App

You should now have the app server at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

You can also configure the port:

serve -p 8000
```
